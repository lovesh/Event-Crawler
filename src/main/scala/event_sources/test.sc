jam together. They initially came up with a few basic melodies, but slowly realized that their collaboration had something more to yield than just a few songs. After a different initial line-up, the band finally turned into a four-piece act with Sachin Banandur (December 2010) and Fidel D’Souza (January 2012). <br><br>New music followed and by March 2012 the band chose five tracks to put into their debut EP &#39;Behosh&#39;.<br><br><strong>Behosh</strong> was released in July 2012. It was self produced by the band with Jason Zachariah (Allegro Fudge, Nathaniel Shool of Music), at the helm of recording, mixing and mastering. Behosh went on to become the top selling album on “OKListen!” – India’s leading online platform for independent music. The title track “Behosh” topped the charts on India’s leading independent music website Nh7.in as well. <br><br>With this album, Parvaaz was nominated for TOTO Awards (2012) and Gima Awards (2013). <br><br>Over the last 3 years Parvaaz has been part of festivals including: Storm Festival, Coorg (2012), Fireflies Festival, Bangalore (2011), The Great Indian October Fest, Bangalore (2011), Roots Festival, Kerela (2012), The Big Mushroom Cloud Festival (2011), The Big Junction Jam (2011), TAAQademy Festival (2012), IndieMarch Festival, Bangalore (2013 and 2014), Nh7 Weekender Pune and Bangalore (2013), MAD Festival, Ooty (2013), and ZeroMile Festival, Nagpur (2013) where they shared the stage with Lucky Ali. In November 2013 the band also collaborated with Raghu Dixit in Mtv’s “Rayban Never Hide Sounds”. <br><br><strong>BARAN<br></strong>Parvaaz is releasing a full length album, consisting of 8 songs.  It&#39;s going to be a culmination of their live work over the past one year and will also include collaborations with new artists. “Baran”, which means rain in Persian, is a soul-searching music

They initially came up with a few basic melodies, but slowly realized that their collaboration had something more to yield than just a few songs. After a different initial line-up, the band finally turned into a four-piece act with Sachin Banandur (December 2010) and Fidel D’Souza (January 2012). <br><br>New music followed and by March 2012 the band chose five tracks to put into their debut EP &#39;Behosh&#39;.<br><br><strong>Behosh</strong> was released in July 2012. It was self produced by the band with Jason Zachariah (Allegro Fudge, Nathaniel Shool of Music), at the helm of recording, mixing and mastering. Behosh went on to become the top selling album on “OKListen!” – India’s leading online platform for independent music. The title track “Behosh” topped the charts on India’s leading independent music website Nh7.in as well. <br><br>With this album, Parvaaz was nominated for TOTO Awards (2012) and Gima Awards (2013). <br><br>Over the last 3 years Parvaaz has been part of festivals including: Storm Festival, Coorg (2012), Fireflies Festival, Bangalore (2011), The Great Indian October Fest, Bangalore (2011), Roots Festival, Kerela (2012), The Big Mushroom Cloud Festival (2011), The Big Junction Jam (2011), TAAQademy Festival (2012), IndieMarch Festival, Bangalore (2013 and 2014), Nh7 Weekender Pune and Bangalore (2013), MAD Festival, Ooty (2013), and ZeroMile Festival, Nagpur (2013) where they shared the stage with Lucky Ali. In November 2013 the band also collaborated with Raghu Dixit in Mtv’s “Rayban Never Hide Sounds”. <br><br><strong>BARAN<br></strong>Parvaaz is releasing a full length album, consisting of 8 songs.  It&#39;s going to be a culmination of their live work over the past one year and will also include collaborations with new artists. “Baran”, which means rain in Persian, is a soul-searching music album the songs talking of society&#39;s unending materialistic quests and greed. <p></p>","modified":"2014-08-09 00:10:19","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"\"Ribbit\" by Pepsi MTV Indies @ blueFROG presents Parvaaz Album Launch: + Supersonics Album Launch","venue_address":"Mathuradas Mills Compound NM Joshi Marg Lower Parel Mumbai 400013 India","geocode_type":"City Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"IN","image":null,"created":"2014-08-01 21:20:02","venue_id":"V0-001-001434734-1","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Blue Frog","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/mumbai/venues/blue-frog-/V0-001-001434734-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"Asia/Kolkata","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MH","postal_code":"400013","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"18.975","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/mumbai/events/digital-om-feat-lifeforms-nitrodrop-/E0-001-073735406-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-073735406-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"Mumbai","link_count":null,"longitude":"72.8258","country_name":"India","country_abbr":"IND","region_name":"Mahārāshtra","start_time":"2014-08-17 20:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" ","modified":"2014-08-09 00:10:15","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Digital Om Feat.
